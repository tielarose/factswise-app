# Features

### Account Creation

Educators create an account,


create classrooms within that account,


and add students to those classrooms.

### Student Login

Students log in via classroom code, their name, and an educator-set password.



### Student Assessments

Before every assessment, students complete a "baseline assessment" in which they match random numbers that appear on the screen. Their response times are recorded and averaged to account for different processing times among different students.


In the assessment portion, student response time is analyzed against that day's baseline, so fluency is personalized for that student (strategy and answer correctness are also factored into fluency).


### Educator Dashboard

Logged in educators can see their student's latest assessment data, toggling between classrooms and sorting by any column. The flag feature automatically highlights students based on their scores.
